# Analyzing Chicago Crime and Housing Data
This is the first of a series of month-long projects I plan to work on to improve my data science skills. The first project I worked on involved exploring Chicago crime data as well as Trulia housing prices. I wanted to be able to delve deep into two projects and try to aggregate them together to create some meaningful analyses. In particular, I focused on answering three questions:

1) Is there a strong relationship between crime rates and housing prices in Chicago at the neighborhood level?

2) Are changes in crime rates a strong predictor for changes in housing prices?

3) Does crime activity in Chicago vary significantly at different times of the day/week? If so, is there a powerful way of visualizing this data?

The iPython Notebook file describes all the code I used to answer these three questions. I tried to organize it as much as possible for readibility.

The two HTML files are two visualizations I made in response to question 3. [One of them](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/haroldli93/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Chicago_Crime_By_Neighborhood.html) allows you to compare crime activity by hour of the week for each neighborhood, and [the other](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/haroldli93/Data-Science-Projects/blob/master/Chicago_Crime_By_Hour.html) allows you to compare crime rates across Chicago neighborhoods at a particular hour of the week.

I also have a writeup of my project on my blog DataBucket - please check it out [here](http://databuckets.blogspot.com/2016/01/exploring-chicago-crime-and-housing.html).

I'm more than happy to recieve any feedback you may have / suggestions for improvement. Thanks!
